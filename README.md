## Repository structure

### code

All data processing, analysis, and simulation code used to generate files in the "data" folder as well as the figures and analyses reported in the manuscript.

-   regret_1_processing.Rmd: used to process the raw experiment data (regret_preregistered_1-merged.csv)

-   regret_1_analysis.Rmd: used to carry out all analyses reported in the manuscript

-   regret_rl.ipyb: contains code for the parameter fitting and simulation components of the computational model reported in the manuscript

### data

All relevant data, including raw and processed experimental data and simulation outputs:

-   regret_preregistered_1-merged.csv: raw experiment data exported from proliferate.alps.science

-   regret_preregistered_1-merged_processed.csv: processed trial-by-trial experiment data (using regret_1_processing.Rmd)

-   regret_preregistered_1-merged_short.csv: processed participant-level experiment data (using regret_1_processing.Rmd)

-   regret_preregistered_1_for_sim.csv: experiment data processed for the parameter fitting step of the computational model

-   regret_1_sim.csv: omega and tau parameters for each participant generated using the GiG model in the regret_rl.ipyb file

-   cf_1_sim.csv: omega and tau parameters for each participant generated using the CS model in the regret_rl.ipyb file

-   simulation_output_all_participants.csv: simulated trial-by-trial data generated by the GiG model in the regret_rl.ipyb file

-   simulation_output_all_participants_null.csv: simulated trial-by-trial data generated by the Null model in the regret_rl.ipyb file

-   cf_simulation_output_all_participants.csv: simulated trial-by-trial data generated by the CS model in the regret_rl.ipyb file
